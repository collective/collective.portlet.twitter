Install
-------

* When you're reading this you have probably already run ``easy_install collective.portlet.twitter.portlets``. Find out how to install setuptools (and EasyInstall) here: http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall
* Create a file called ``collective.portlet.twitter.portlets-configure.zcml`` in the ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  The file should only contain this


    <include package="collective.portlet.twitter.portlets" />


Alternatively, if you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to manage your project, you can do this:

* Add ``collective.portlet.twitter.portlets`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:

    [buildout]
    eggs = collective.portlet.twitter.portlets

* Re-run buildout, e.g. with:

    $ ./bin/buildout

You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package from another package's configure.zcml file.
